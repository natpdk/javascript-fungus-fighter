// State Variables can be declared outside of the onReady

// Example:
// let fungusHP = 100;
    
    // Make sure you check the index.html file! 
    // There are lots of buttons and things ready for you to hook into here!

    //My To-Do List:
        //Attack Buttons Need To:
            //Lose HP for the fungus.
            //Lose AP for me
                //Make sure these numbers can't become negative (0 is the lowest they can go).
        //DOM Needs To:
            //Update text above the attack buttons
            //Update the text above the fungus
            //If the fungus dies, have it switch from CSS class "walk" to CSS class "dead"
            //If I run out of AP, have the fungus css class swith from "walk" to "jump"
            //When AP reached 0, disable all the attack buttons

    //My Initial Notes:
        //My first thought is to make a function for each attack buttons
            //Each button will have elements as follows:
                //They will make the AP go down the proper amount.
                //They will have the HP go down the proper amount.
                //They will trigger the proper animation.
        //I think I also need a function that will be called within each of those functions to notify the trigger if either I or the fungus reach 0
            //Something like an if/else statement to trigger when the appropriate bar is at 0 to make the right animation happen, else render the button as usual?

    let heroAP = 100

        document.getElementById('hp-meter').value = fungusHP;
